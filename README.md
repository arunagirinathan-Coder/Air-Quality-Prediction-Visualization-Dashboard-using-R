## Air Quality Prediction & Visualization Dashboard

An interactive R Shiny dashboard that visualizes air quality trends and provides short-term forecasts (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂) for urban locations using time-series data.

📌 Project Overview

**This project aims to:**

Analyze air pollution data from global cities

Visualize key pollutants and weather conditions over time

Forecast short-term air quality using time-series models

Provide an intuitive, interactive interface for exploration and insights

## 📈 Features

✅ Interactive dashboard (Shiny)
✅ Daily trends of PM2.5, PM10, and NO₂
✅ Location-wise filtering
✅ 7-day forecast using ARIMA models
✅ Clean, responsive UI with dynamic charts
